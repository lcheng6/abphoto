Photo Upload App for American Boxing

abphoto is a demonstration app for UI design, photo manipulation, and social app that I did for a boxing gym www.americanboxing.net that I was training in.  It is built to be a instagram clone with Facebook linkup to the boxing gym's facebook business page.  This is app is built to demonstrate of some iOS's photo callbacks, UI designs similar to Instagram, and an photo upload feature with iOS's social API and Facebook's own API.
